          If present, indicates that an adjustment is associated with

          caused by a specific issue. Caution is required: adjustment
          metadata is sometimes applied to the original line-item as well
          as the line-item capturing the adjustment (e.g. with a negative cost).
          It's also sometimes associated with a Credit. The logic depends
          on the adjustment mode and has not been reflected in this model.
