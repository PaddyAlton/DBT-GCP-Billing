    description: >
      Base table for GCP standard billing export. Some flattening applied.
      Each record denotes a single billing record, with any associated
      credits attached. Costs are usually positive. Some costs are zero
      (and have credits attached), or even negative (e.g. refunds). Most
      credits are negative (money back), but not all. Some rows appear
      duplicated; the standard export doesn't contain resource-level data
      so it's possible for two line items to be indistinguishable.
    columns:
